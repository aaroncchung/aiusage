/**
 * Reprice the records a migration queued in `pending_cost_recalc`.
 *
 * A migration that changes a record's token counts cannot recompute its cost
 * itself: it runs before the curated prices are seeded and before the runtime
 * price table is loaded. It queues the record instead, and this runs once
 * pricing is ready, using the same runtime price table (registry, aliases and
 * legacy `config.priceOverrides`) the parsers price new records with.
 *
 * A record whose model no longer resolves to a price becomes
 * `cost = 0, cost_source = 'unknown'`, as *Recalculate pricing* would leave
 * it, rather than keeping a cost computed from the old token counts. Logged
 * costs are left alone. `updated_at` is bumped so the new cost is published.
 * The queue is drained in the same transaction, so an interrupted run is
 * simply repeated on the next database open. Returns the number of records
 * repriced.
